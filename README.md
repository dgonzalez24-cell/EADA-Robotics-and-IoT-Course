# EADA Robotics and IoT Course

A hands-on course introducing **ROS 2 (Robot Operating System)** and **IoT concepts** through practical exercises.

## Course Overview

This course teaches the fundamentals of robotics middleware and IoT communication patterns using ROS 2 Jazzy. Students will learn to:
- Build ROS 2 nodes in Python
- Implement publisher/subscriber patterns
- Work with robotics simulation tools (turtlesim)
- Apply IoT concepts like telemetry and dashboards
- Develop distributed systems with message passing

## Prerequisites

- **Python knowledge**: Variables, functions, classes, virtual environments
- **No robotics experience required**: We start from scratch
- **Operating System**: Linux (Ubuntu 24.04 recommended), or Windows/macOS with alternative setup paths

## Course Structure

### [0. Course Preparation](0_course_preparation/0_course_preparation.md)
Setup instructions for three different paths:
- **Path A**: Docker setup (Linux users)
- **Path B**: WSL2 + Native ROS2 (Windows users)
- **Path C**: VM setup (macOS users)

### [1. Class 1 Exercises](1_class_1_exercises/1_class_1_exercises.md)
Introduction to ROS 2 fundamentals:
- **Exercise 1**: Hello World Node
- **Exercise 2**: Publisher/Subscriber pattern
- **Exercise 3**: Turtlesim basics
- **Exercise 4**: Turtlesim control and IoT Dashboard (take-home)

### [2. Class 2 Exercises](2_class_2_exercises/2_class_2_exercises.md)
Advanced ROS 2 concepts:
- **Services**: Creating and calling ROS 2 services
- **TF Broadcasting**: Coordinate frame transforms
- **Actions**: Implementing action servers
- **URDF/Xacro**: Robot description formats

### [3. Class 3 Exercises](3_class_3_exercises/3_class_3_exercises.md)
Simulation and autonomous control concepts:
- **Gazebo fundamentals**: Worlds, models, plugins, and simulation runtime
- **Gazebo transport**: Inspecting topics/services and scene state
- **ROS-Gazebo Integration**: Bridging with `ros_gz_bridge`
- **Model spawning**: Creating entities with `ros_gz_sim/create`
